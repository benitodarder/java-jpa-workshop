# jpa-workshop

Some concept proofs and tests for JPA using different providers:

* EclipseLink
* Hibernate

Includes:

* jpa-workshop-jpa-providers: Retrieve data from a sample database and show can Hibernate and EclipseLink can be easy swapped

* jpa-workshop-copy-values: Copies data from one table to another one in a hierarchic model. Only runs in Hibernate due to the lack of DiscriminatorColumn
